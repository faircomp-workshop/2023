         <p><b>Abstract:</b> TBA </p>
         <p><b>Bio:</b> Ricardo Baeza-Yates is currently Director of Research (part-time) at the Institute for Experiential AI of Northeastern University, Silicon Valley campus, since January 2021. He is also a member of the DATA Lab at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. The rest of the time he does consulting for tech startups, companies and non-profit international institutions, particularly in responsible AI.

He is actively involved as expert in many initiatives, committees or advisory boards related to Responsible AI all around the world: Global AI Ethics Consortium, Global Partnership on AI, IADB's fAIr LAC Initiative (Latin America and the Caribbean), Spain's Council of AI, and ACM's US Technology Policy Committee. He is also a co-founder of OptIA in Chile, a NGO devoted to algorithmic transparency and inclusion, and member of the editorial committee of the new AI and Ethics Journal where he co-authored an article highlighting the importance of research freedom on AI ethics.
