         <p><b>Bio:</b> Ricardo Baeza-Yates is currently Director of Research (part-time) at the Institute for Experiential AI of Northeastern University, Silicon Valley campus, since January 2021. He is also a member of the DATA Lab at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. The rest of the time he does consulting for tech startups, companies and non-profit international institutions, particularly in responsible AI.

He is actively involved as expert in many initiatives, committees or advisory boards related to Responsible AI all around the world: Global AI Ethics Consortium, Global Partnership on AI, IADB's fAIr LAC Initiative (Latin America and the Caribbean), Spain's Council of AI, and ACM's US Technology Policy Committee. He is also a co-founder of OptIA in Chile, a NGO devoted to algorithmic transparency and inclusion, and member of the editorial committee of the new AI and Ethics Journal where he co-authored an article highlighting the importance of research freedom on AI ethics.

<!--             <p><b>Title:</b> Machine Learning in Mental Health</p>-->
<!--             <p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of (mental) healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of ML tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This talk draws on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-talia/">Project Talia</a>, a recently retired, three-year research collaboration between Microsoft Research and SilverCloud Health, to describe current challenges and opportunities for applications of ML in mental health when designing for real-world implementation. -->
<!--               <a href="https://www.silvercloudhealth.com/uk">SilverCloudHealth</a> is an evidence-based, digital, on-demand mental health platform that delivers Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) programs for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Patients work through therapy contents by themselves in their own time in combination with regular assistance from an iCBT supporter, who provides guidance and continuous encouragement to the patient and helps them work through identified difficulties. Aiming to maximize the effects and outcomes of human support in this format, the collaboration explored how methods of ML could assist iCBT supporters in providing more effective, personalized care to their patients. To this end, the talk will give an introduction to three specific invstigations for deriving ML insights: (1) user subtyping based on patterns of engagement; (2) extracting context-specific communication patterns; and (3) predicting reliable improvement outcomes. It closes with broader socio-technical considerations and challenges involved for the responsible design and workflow integration of ML within sensitive healthcare contexts.</p>-->
<!--             <p><b>Bio:</b> Anja is a Senior Researcher in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/biomedical-imaging/">Biomedical Imaging</a> team within Microsoft Health Futures, based at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a>. Her research explores innovative approaches for applying AI and Machine Learning in real-world healthcare contexts with a focus towards end-to-end AI application development. As a researcher with a background in human-computer interaction (HCI) much of her work focuses on the responsible design of AI technology to benefit people.</p>-->
