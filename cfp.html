      <h2>Workshop Theme and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        We aim FairComp to be an interdisciplinary forum beyond publications’ solicitation that brings together academia and industry.
        Notably, we seek to bring together researchers and practitioners
        whose work lies within the ACM SIGCHI domains (e.g., UbiComp,
        HCI, CSCW), as well as Web sciences, FAccT, ML & AI, Social
        sciences, Philosophy, Law, Psychology, and others. In particular, the goal of this workshop is to
        collaboratively:
      </p>

        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">A</span>ssess the evolving socio-technical themes and concerns in relation to fairness across ubiquitous technologies, ranging from health, behavioural, and emotion sensing to human-activity recognition, mobility, and navigation.      </p>

        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">M</span>ap the space of ethical risks and possibilities regarding technological interventions (e.g., input modalities, learning paradigms, design choices).      </p>

        <p>
          <span class="first-letter">E</span>nvision new sensing and data-acquisition paradigms to fairly and accurately gather ubiquitous physical, physiological, and experiential qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">E</span>xplore novel methods for bias mitigation and investigate their suitability for diverse ubiquitous case studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">S</span>tart a discourse around the future of ``ubiquitous fairness'' and co-create research agenda(s) for meaningfully addressing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="first-letter">C</span>onsolidate an international network of researchers to further develop these research agendas through funding proposals and through steering future funding instruments.
      </p>

        <p>The topics
        of interest include -but are not limited- to the following:
        <ul>
          <li>New definitions, metrics, and criteria of fairness and robustness, tailored for ubiquitous computing</li>
          <li>Indirect notions of fairness on devices (e.g., unfair resource allocation, energy, connectivity)</li>
          <li>New methods for bias identification and mitigation</li>
          <li>Bias, discrimination, and measurement errors in data, labels, and under-represented input modalities</li>
          <li>New benchmark datasets for fairness and robustness evaluation (e.g., sensor data with protected attributes)</li>
          <li>Geographical equity across datasets and applications (e.g., WEIRD research, Global South)</li>
          <li>New user study methodologies beyond conventional protocols (e.g., Fairness-by-Design)</li>
          <li>Robustness (e.g., out-of-distribution generalization, uncertainty quantification) of ML models in high-stake and real-world applications</li>
          <li>Investigation of fairness trade-offs (e.g., fairness vs. accuracy, privacy, resource efficiency)</li>
          <li>Implications of regulatory frameworks for UbiComp</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Submission
        details</h2>
        <p>
          We invite complete and ongoing research works, use cases, field studies, review, as well as position papers between 4-6 pages (excluding references). Submission should follow UbiComp's publication vendor <a href="https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2023/authors/formatting/">instructions</a>, and submitted through <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions">PCS</a>.
          Specifically, the correct template for <strong>submission</strong> is double-column Word Submission Template or double-column LaTeX Template, and the correct template for <strong>publication</strong> (i.e., after conditional acceptance) is single-column Word Submission Template or double-column LaTeX template.
          Each article will be reviewed by 2 reviewers from a panel of experts consisting of external reviewers and organizers. To ensure accessibility, all authors should adhere to SIGCHI's <a href="https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/">Accessible Submission Guidelines</a>.
          All accepted publications will be published on the workshop website and the ACM Digital Library as part of the UbiComp 2023 proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper needs to register for the conference and the workshop itself. During the workshop, each paper will be presented in-person by one of the authors.
        </p>

      <p><strong>All papers need to be anonymized</strong>. Any
        questions should be mailed to faircomp.workshop [AT] gmail.com.
